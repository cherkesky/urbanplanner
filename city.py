'''
In the previous Urban Planner exercise, you practices defining custom types to represent buildings. Now you need to create a type to represent your city. Here are the requirements for the class. You define the properties and methods.

Name of the city.
The mayor of the city.
Year the city was established.
A collection of all of the buildings in the city.
A method to add a building to the city.
Remember, each class should be in its own file. Define the City class in the city.py file.

class City:
  def __init__ (self, name, mayor, year_established):
    self.name = name
    self.mayor = mayor
    self.year_established = year_established
    self.city_buildings = list()

  def addBuildings(building):
    self.city_buildings.append(building)
